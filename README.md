# ðŸ§  Programming Logic â€“ Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercise lists from the **Programming Logic** course, taken during the first semester of the **Computer Science** program at [UFCA](https://ufca.edu.br) (Federal University of Cariri).

All exercises are implemented in **C**, focusing on foundational programming concepts and problem-solving skills.
